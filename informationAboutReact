JSX==> javaScript in form xml i.e  create its own virtual DOM.
	Any html things must be in single DOM container.
	(javaScript 6)
javascript 6 have "class" reserved keyword -> So, we use className in place of class.

Props:- It is like property i.e attribute of html.
	props are passed to the conponent 
	It is immutable 
	props - is functional conponent
`	this.props - is class component

State can only used with class component not functional component.

	State can be managed within component 
	State can be changed
	use State Hook in functional component
	this.state - class component
